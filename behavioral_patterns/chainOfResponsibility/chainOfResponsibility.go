/*
Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern
that allows passing request along the chain of potential
 handlers until one of them handles request.

Letâ€™s look at the Chain of Responsibility pattern with the case of a
hospital app. A hospital could have multiple departments such as:

    Reception
    Doctor
    Medical examination room
    Cashier

Whenever any patient arrives, they first get to Reception, then to Doctor,
then to Medicine Room, and then to Cashier (and so on). The patient is
being sent through a chain of departments, where each department sends the
patient further down the chain once their function is completed.
